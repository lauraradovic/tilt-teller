To run the application, follow the steps below:

**Clone the Repository:**
Inside the terminal, execute the following command:

git clone https://github.com/lauraradovic/tilt-teller.git

**Navigate to the Cloned Directory:**
Move into the project directory using the command:

cd tilt-teller

**Install Dependencies:**
Inside the terminal, enter the command to install all necessary packages:

npm install

Then, install Expo CLI globally with:

npm install --global expo-cli

This allows you to use the 'expo' command globally for project interactions.

**Start the Application:**
Enter the command:

expo start

After the project starts, follow the instructions to choose the platform (Android, iOS) or scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your device.

npx expo start --tunnel

This command starts Expo with the tunnel option, enabling access to the project from devices that are not on the same Wi-Fi network.
